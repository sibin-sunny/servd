    instructions: [
      {
        step: 1,
        title: "Marinate the Chicken",
        instruction:
          "Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a bowl, mix yogurt with 1 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp chili powder, and salt. Add chicken pieces and marinate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 4 hours in the refrigerator).",
        tip: "For extra tender chicken, marinate overnight in the refrigerator.",
      },
      {
        step: 2,
        title: "Cook the Chicken",
        instruction:
          "Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add marinated chicken and cook for 6-8 minutes until lightly charred and cooked through. Remove and set aside.",
        tip: "Don't overcrowd the pan - cook in batches if needed for better browning.",
      },
      {
        step: 3,
        title: "Prepare the Base",
        instruction:
          "In the same pan, add 2 tbsp butter. Once melted, add finely chopped onions and cook until golden brown (about 8-10 minutes). Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant.",
        tip: null,
      },
      {
        step: 4,
        title: "Build the Sauce",
        instruction:
          "Add tomato puree, remaining spices (chili powder, turmeric, cumin, garam masala), and salt. Cook for 10-12 minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the oil separates from the masala.",
        tip: "This step is crucial - cooking the masala properly removes the raw tomato taste.",
      },
      {
        step: 5,
        title: "Add Cream and Chicken",
        instruction:
          "Lower the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Add the cooked chicken pieces and simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.",
        tip: null,
      },
      {
        step: 6,
        title: "Final Touch",
        instruction:
          "Crush the kasuri methi between your palms and add to the curry. Add remaining 2 tbsp butter and stir gently. Simmer for 2 more minutes.",
        tip: "Crushing the kasuri methi releases its aromatic oils and enhances the flavor.",
      },
      {
        step: 7,
        title: "Garnish and Serve",
        instruction:
          "Turn off the heat. Garnish with fresh cilantro and a swirl of cream. Serve hot with naan, roti, or basmati rice.",

    tips: [
      "For a smokier flavor, char the chicken on a grill or under the broiler before adding to the sauce.",
      "Adjust the chili powder based on your spice preference - Kashmiri chili is mild and adds color.",
      "Use full-fat dairy products for the richest, creamiest texture.",
      "Leftover butter chicken tastes even better the next day as flavors develop overnight.",
      "If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water or chicken stock to thin it out.",
